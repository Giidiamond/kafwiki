                <h1>Story</h1>
                <h2>Season 1</h2>
                <p>Mr. Kasen and his friend, Mr. Pacman, fight against their foes, these foes being, of course, Monster Kevin, Brian, Sabrina, Ryanne, Pen, and Orian, and finally <b style="color: red;">[REDACTED]</b>.</p>
                <h2>Season 2: Pacman Vs MK</h2>
                <p>As the name of this season suggests, it follows Mr. Pacman and his allies trying to stop fearsome Monster Kevin as he tries to take over the Papergutory.</p>
                <h2>Season 3: Pacman's dream</h2>
                <p>Mr. Pacman is sleeping on his bed, nothing out of the ordinary, until… He gets a strange dream of someone who looks like MK, but they are blue. </p>
                <h2>Season 4: █████</h2>
                <p>I stood upon the main section of the Master's council room, and I asked, “Why, why did you forsake these realities?” 
                <br>They said, “Oh,█████, don't you know? You need to make some sacrifices to ensure the survival of reality itself.”, 
                <br>“Does that justify the destruction you people have caused?” I said in an irritated tone. “Ahh, █████ , didn't you hear 
                <br>us correctly?“ said one of the masters. “It doesn't matter if it's good or not. What does matter is survival of the multiverse 
                <br>as a whole.” “Why should I care about that? Those universes had billions upon billions of years' worth of history, and you 
                <br>are just erasing them like they were never there? For the sake of this quote-on-quote survival?“ I said now in a frustrated-as-
                <br>hell tone, “ █████ , you're acting childish. Do you honestly think every universe can ever exist at once? No. It doesn't work 
                <br>like that,” said one of the masters. “Don't you have better things to do aside from this foolish argument?” Said another master, 
                <br>“No, but” “No? No, what? Arguing about pointless, wasted universes that serve no purpose is better than doing anything else?” 
                <br>“Wait, no.” “Guven, return to do your sleeping quarters now.”, “But…”, “I SAID NOW.” Uh… fine, I guess. I leave the room and 
                <br>make my way to my bedroom. …that's not going to be all; I will pay for what they've done.
